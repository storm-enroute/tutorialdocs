## Reactors 101

As we learned previously, event streams always propagate events on a single thread.
This is useful from the standpoint of program comprehension, but we still need a way
to express concurrency in our programs. In this section, we will see how this is done
with reactors.

A reactor is the basic unit of concurrency. For readers familiar with the actor model,
a reactor is close to the concept of an actor. While actors receive messages, reactors
receive events. However, while an actor in particular state has only a single point in
its definition where it can receive a message, a reactor can receive an event from
many different sources at any time. Despite this flexibility, one reactor will always
process **at most one** event at any time. We say that events received by a reactor
*serialize*, similar to how messages received by an actor are serialized.

To be able to create new reactors, we need a `ReactorSystem` object, which tracks
reactors in a single machine.

```scala
val system = new ReactorSystem("test-system")
```

<div class='panel-group' id='acc-1'>
  <div class='panel panel-default'>
    <div class='panel-heading'>
      <h4 class='panel-title'>
        <a data-toggle='collapse' data-parent='#acc-1'
          href='#clps-2'>
          Java
        </a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id='clps-2' class='panel-collapse collapse'>
      <div class='panel-body'>
{% capture s %}
{% include reactors-java-reactors-system.html %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ s | markdownify }}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
Before we can start a reactor instance, we need to define its template. One way to
do this is to call `Reactor.apply[T]` method, which returns a `Proto` object for the
reactor. The `Proto` object is called a *prototype* of the reactors.
The following reactor prints all the events it receives to the standard output:

```scala
val proto: Proto[Reactor[String]] = Reactor[String] { self =>
  self.main.events onEvent {
    x => println(x)
  }
}
```

<div class='panel-group' id='acc-3'>
  <div class='panel panel-default'>
    <div class='panel-heading'>
      <h4 class='panel-title'>
        <a data-toggle='collapse' data-parent='#acc-3'
          href='#clps-4'>
          Java
        </a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id='clps-4' class='panel-collapse collapse'>
      <div class='panel-body'>
{% capture s %}
{% include reactors-java-reactors-anonymous.html %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ s | markdownify }}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
Lets examine this code more closely. The `Reactor.apply` method is called with the
argument `String`. This means that the reactor encoded in the resulting `Proto`
object only receives events whose type is `String`. This is the first difference
with respect to the standard actor model, in which actors can receive messages of
any type. Events received by reactors are well typed.

In the reactor model, every reactor can access a special event stream called
`main.events`, which emits events that the reactor receives from other reactors.
Since we are declaring an anonymous reactor with the `Reactor.apply` method, we need
to add a prefix `self.` to access members of the reactor.
We previously learned that we can call `onEvent` to register callbacks to event
streams, and we used it in this example to print the events using `println`.

After defining a reactor template, the next step is to spawn a new reactor. We do
this by calling the `spawn` method on the reactor system:

```scala
val ch: Channel[String] = system.spawn(proto)
```

<div class='panel-group' id='acc-5'>
  <div class='panel panel-default'>
    <div class='panel-heading'>
      <h4 class='panel-title'>
        <a data-toggle='collapse' data-parent='#acc-5'
          href='#clps-6'>
          Java
        </a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id='clps-6' class='panel-collapse collapse'>
      <div class='panel-body'>
{% capture s %}
{% include reactors-java-reactors-spawn.html %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ s | markdownify }}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
The method `spawn` takes a `Proto` object as a parameter. The `Proto` object can
generally encode the reactor's constructor arguments, scheduler, name and other
options. In our example, we created a `Proto` object for an anonymous reactor
with the `Reactor.apply` method, so we don't have any constructor arguments. We will
later see alternative ways of declaring reactors and configuring prototypes.

The method `spawn` does two things. First, it registers and starts a new reactor
instance. Second, it returns a `Channel` object, which is used to send events to
the newly created reactor. We can show the relationship between a reactor, its
event stream and the channel as follows:

```
  "Hello world!"                            
    |              #-----------------------#
    |              |    Reactor[String]    |
    V              |                       |
Channel[String] ---o--> Events[String]     |
      ^            |                       |
      |            |                       |
      |            #-----------------------#
   "Hola!"                                  
```

The only way for the outside world to access the inside of a reactor is to send
events to its channel. These events are eventually delivered to the corresponding
event stream, which the reactor can listen to. The channel and event stream can only
pass events whose type corresponds to the type of the reactor.

Let's send an event to `HelloReactor`. We do this by calling the bang operator `!`
on the channel:

```scala
ch ! "Hola!"
```

<div class='panel-group' id='acc-7'>
  <div class='panel panel-default'>
    <div class='panel-heading'>
      <h4 class='panel-title'>
        <a data-toggle='collapse' data-parent='#acc-7'
          href='#clps-8'>
          Java
        </a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id='clps-8' class='panel-collapse collapse'>
      <div class='panel-body'>
{% capture s %}
{% include reactors-java-reactors-send.html %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ s | markdownify }}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
Running the last statement should print `"Hola!"` to the standard output.

### Defining and configuring reactors

In the previous section, we saw how to define a reactor using the `Reactor.apply`
method. In this section, we take a look at an alternative way of defining a reactor --
by extending the `Reactor` class. Recall that the `Reactor.apply` method defines an
anonymous reactor template. Extending the `Reactor` class declares a named reactor
template.

In the following, we declare `HelloReactor`, which must be a top-level class:

```scala
class HelloReactor extends Reactor[String] {
  main.events onEvent {
    x => println(x)
  }
}
```

<div class='panel-group' id='acc-9'>
  <div class='panel panel-default'>
    <div class='panel-heading'>
      <h4 class='panel-title'>
        <a data-toggle='collapse' data-parent='#acc-9'
          href='#clps-10'>
          Java
        </a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id='clps-10' class='panel-collapse collapse'>
      <div class='panel-body'>
{% capture s %}
{% include reactors-java-reactors-template.html %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ s | markdownify }}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
To run this reactor, we first create a prototype to configure it. The method
`Proto.apply` takes the type of the reactor and returns a prototype for that
reactor type. We then call the `spawn` method with that `Proto` object to start the
reactor:

```scala
val ch = system.spawn(Proto[HelloReactor])
ch ! "Howdee!"
```

<div class='panel-group' id='acc-11'>
  <div class='panel panel-default'>
    <div class='panel-heading'>
      <h4 class='panel-title'>
        <a data-toggle='collapse' data-parent='#acc-11'
          href='#clps-12'>
          Java
        </a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id='clps-12' class='panel-collapse collapse'>
      <div class='panel-body'>
{% capture s %}
{% include reactors-java-reactors-spawn-template.html %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ s | markdownify }}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
We can also use the prototype to, for example, set the scheduler that the
reactor instance should use. If we want the reactor instance to run on its
dedicated thread to give it more priority, we can do the following:

```scala
system.spawn(Proto[HelloReactor].withScheduler(
  ReactorSystem.Bundle.schedulers.newThread))
```

<div class='panel-group' id='acc-13'>
  <div class='panel panel-default'>
    <div class='panel-heading'>
      <h4 class='panel-title'>
        <a data-toggle='collapse' data-parent='#acc-13'
          href='#clps-14'>
          Java
        </a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id='clps-14' class='panel-collapse collapse'>
      <div class='panel-body'>
{% capture s %}
{% include reactors-java-reactors-with-scheduler.html %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ s | markdownify }}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
The call to `withScheduler` returns a new prototype that runs on a predefined
scheduler called `ReactorSystem.Bundle.schedulers.newThread`. A reactor started like
this is using this scheduler. Reactor systems allow registering custom schedulers.
In the following, we define a custom `Timer` scheduler, which schedules the reactor
for execution once every `1000` milliseconds:

```scala
system.bundle.registerScheduler("customTimer", new Scheduler.Timer(1000))
val periodic = system.spawn(Proto[HelloReactor].withScheduler("customTimer"))
periodic ! "Ohayo!"
```

<div class='panel-group' id='acc-15'>
  <div class='panel panel-default'>
    <div class='panel-heading'>
      <h4 class='panel-title'>
        <a data-toggle='collapse' data-parent='#acc-15'
          href='#clps-16'>
          Java
        </a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id='clps-16' class='panel-collapse collapse'>
      <div class='panel-body'>
{% capture s %}
{% include reactors-java-reactors-custom-scheduler.html %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ s | markdownify }}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
By running the code above, we can see that the event `"Ohayo!"` is processed only 1
second after the reactor starts.

There are several other configuration options for `Proto` objects, listed in the
online API docs. We can summarize this section as follows -- starting a reactor is
generally a three step process:

1. A reactor template is created by extending the `Reactor` class.
2. A reactor `Proto` configuration object is created with the `Proto.apply` method.
3. A reactor instance is started with the `spawn` method of the reactor system.

For convenience, we can fuse the first two steps by using the `Reactor.apply`
method, which creates an anonymous reactor template and directly returns a
prototype object of type `Proto[I]`, for some reactor type `I`.
Typically, we do this in tests or in the REPL.

## Using channels

Now that we understand how to create and configure reactors in different ways, we can
take a closer look at channels -- reactor's means of communicating with its environment.
As noted before, every reactor is created with a default channel called `main`, which is
usually sufficient. But sometimes a reactor needs to be able to receive more than just
one type of an event, and needs additional channels for this purpose.

Let's declare a reactor that stores key-value pairs. We can do this by defining the
following reactor:

```scala
import scala.collection._

class PutOnlyReactor[K, V] extends Reactor[(K, V)] {
  val map = mutable.Map[K, V]()

  main.events onEvent {
    case (k, v) => map(k) = v
  }
}
```

The `PutOnlyReactor` accepts events of type `(K, V)` for some generic type parameters
`K` and `V`. This is fine for the purposes of storing key-value pairs into this reactor,
but it does not make it possible to query values stored to specific keys. For this, the
sender must give the reactor the desired key of type `K` and a channel of type
`Channel[V]`, on which the value `V` can be sent back.

Since the same input channel serves two purposes, we need the following data type:

```scala
trait Op[K, V]

case class Put[K, V](k: K, v: V) extends Op[K, V]

case class Get[K, V](k: K, ch: Channel[V]) extends Op[K, V]
```

With the `Op[K, V]` data type, we can define the following reactor:

```scala
class MapReactor[K, V] extends Reactor[Op[K, V]] {
  val map = mutable.Map[K, V]()

  main.events onEvent {
    case Put(k, v) => map(k) = v
    case Get(k, ch) => ch ! map(k)
  }
}
```

Let's start `MapReactor` and test it. We will use the `MapReactor` to store some
DNS aliases. We will map each alias `String` key to a URL, where the URLs are
represented with the `List[String]` type. We first initialize as follows:

```scala
val mapper = system.spawn(Proto[MapReactor[String, List[String]]])
```

We then send a couple of `Put` messages to store some alias values:

```scala
mapper ! Put("dns-main", "dns1" :: "lan" :: Nil)
mapper ! Put("dns-backup", "dns2" :: "com" :: Nil)
```

Next, we create a client reactor that we control by sending it `String` events. This
means that the reactor's type will be `Reactor[String]`. However, the client reactor
will also have to contact the `MapReactor` and ask it for one of the URLs. Since the
`MapReactor` can only send it back events that are `List[String]`, its default
channel will not be able to receive the reply. The client will have to provide the
`MapReactor` with a different channel. The following expression is used to create
a new channel:

```
val c: Connector[EventType] = system.channels.open[EventType]
```

The `Connector` object contains two members: `channel`, which is the newly created
channel, and `events`, which is the event stream corresponding to that channel. The
event stream propagates all events that were sent and delivered on the channel, and
can only be used by the reactor that created it. The channel, on the other hand,
*can* be shared with other reactors.

> Event streams are not shareable objects -- never send an event stream created by
> one reactor to some other reactor.

The expression `system.channels` returns a channel builder object, which provides
methods like `named` or `daemon`, used to customize the channel (see online API docs
for more details). In this example, we will use the `daemon` channel, to indicate
that the channel does not need to be closed (more on that a bit later). To create a
new channel, we call `open` on the channel builder with the appropriate type
parameter.

Let's define a client reactor that waits for a `"start"` message, and then checks
a DNS entry. This reactor will use the `onMatch` handler instead of `onEvent`, to
listen only to certain `String` events and ignore others:

```scala
val ch = system.spawn(Reactor[String] { self =>
  self.main.events onMatch {
    case "start" =>
      val reply = system.channels.daemon.open[List[String]]
      mapper ! Get("dns-main", reply.channel)
      reply.events onEvent { url =>
        println(url)
      }
    case "end" =>
      self.main.seal()
  }
})
```

Above, when the reactor receives the `"start"` event, it opens a new channel `reply`
that accepts `List[String]` events. It then sends the `MapReactor` a `Get` event
with the `"dns-main"` key and the channel. Then, the reactor listens to events sent
back and prints the URL to the standard output.

Another new thing in this code is in the `"end"` case of the pattern match. Here,
the reactor calls `seal` on the main channel to indicate that it will not receive
any further events on that channel. Once all non-daemon channels become sealed, the
reactor terminates.

> A reactor terminates either when all its non-daemon channels are sealed, or when
> its constructor or some event handler throws an exception.

Lets start the client reactor and see what happens:

```scala
ch ! "start"
```

At this point, we should witness the URL on the standard output.
Finally, we can send the `"end"` message to the `Reactor` to stop it.

```scala
ch ! "end"
```
