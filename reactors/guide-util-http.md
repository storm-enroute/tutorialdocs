## Http Service

In this section, we show how to use the `Http` service.
The `Http` service allows each reactor to act as an HTTP server.
To use this service, we need to add the `reactors-http` dependency:

```scala
libraryDependencies +=
  "io.reactors" %% "reactors-http" % "<version>"
```

The `Http` service can be invoked by different reactors.
A server instance is associated with the first reactor
that requests a specific port. Until that reactor terminates,
other reactors cannot use that port (but they are allowed to request other ports).
After a reactor acquires a specific port, it effectively becomes the server
at that port. Inbound requests for that port are by default handled on this reactor.

To reply to user requests, the reactor then needs to define a set of routes.
Each route specifies how to respond to user requests coming on a different
path of the URI. Depending on the route, the reactor can respons with an HTML page,
with plain text, or with a resource that has a custom MIME type.

Let's start by importing the `io.reactors` and the `io.reactors.http` packages:

```scala
import io.reactors._
import io.reactors.http._
```

Next, we create a new reactor system, used to hold the server reactor.

```scala
val system = ReactorSystem.default("test-system")
```

We can now declare the server reactor.
Our reactor will first fetch the `Http` service singleton with the expression
`self.system.service[Http]`, and then invoke the `seq` method combined with either
`text`, `html` or `resource` to install different routes. We will install three
different routes: `/hello`, `/about` and `/contact`, along with the corresponding
handlers. Note that in the case of the `/hello` handler, we read the `name`
parameter from the map of request parameters, and use it to greet the user.

```scala
val server = Reactor[Unit] { self =>
  val http = self.system.service[Http]
  http.seq(9500).text("/hello") { req =>
    val name = req.parameters.getOrElse("name", Seq("World"))
    Events(s"Hello, $name.")
  }
  http.seq(9500).html("/about") { req =>
    Events("""
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>About</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h2>About this website</h2>
      <p>
        This website was server using the <code>Http</code> service,
        and was created for you by a custom reactor.
      </p>
    </body>
    </html>
    """)
  }
  http.seq(9500).resource("/contact")("text/xml") { req =>
    val xml = """
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <note>
      <website>http://reactors.io</website>
      <source>https://github.com/reactors-io/reactors</source>
    </note>
    """.trim
    Events(new java.io.ByteArrayInputStream(xml.getBytes))
  }
}
```

Having defined the server reactor prototype, we next need to spawn it.
This is done as follows:

```scala
system.spawn(server)
```

If necessary, you can assign a custom scheduler to your server reactor.
For example, if you want to ensure that your server gets a high priority,
you can use the custom thread scheduler. See the Schedulers section
for more details.

You can now point your browser to
[http://localhost:9500/hello](http://localhost:9500/hello),
and see your web page in action.
