## Services

In the earlier sections,
we learned that reactors delimit concurrent executions,
and that event streams allow routing events within each reactor.
This is already a powerful set of abstractions,
and we can use reactors and event streams to write all kinds of distributed programs.
However, such a model is restricted to reactor computations only --
we cannot, for example, start blocking I/O operations, read from a temperature sensor,
wait until a GPU computation completes, or do logging.
In some cases,
we need to interact with the native capabilities of the OS,
or tap into a rich ecosystem of existing libraries.
For this purpose,
every reactor system has a set of **services** --
protocols that relate event streams to the outside world.

In this section,
we will take a closer look at various services that are available by default,
and also show how to implement custom services and plug them into reactor systems.

### The logging service

We will start with the simplest possible service called `Log`.
This service is used to print logging messages to the standard output.
In the following, we create an anonymous reactor that uses the `Log` service.
We start by importing the `Log` service.

```scala
import io.reactors.services.Log
```

Next, we create a reactor system, and start a reactor instance.
The reactor invokes the `service` method on the reactor system,
which returns the service with the specified type.
The reactor then calls the `apply` method on the `log` to print a message,
and seals itself.

```scala
val system = ReactorSystem.default("tutorial-system")

system.spawn(Reactor[String] { self =>
  val log = system.service[Log]
  log("Reactor started!")
  self.main.seal()
})
```

Running the above snippet prints the timestamped message to the standard output.

This example is very simple, but we use it to describe some
important properties of services.

- Reactor system's method `service[S]` returns a service of type `S`.
- The service obtained this way is a lazily initialized singleton instance -- there
  exists at most one instance of the service per reactor system, and it is created
  only after being requested by some reactor.
- Some standard services are eagerly initialized when the reactor system gets
  created. Such services are usually available as a standalone method on the
  `ReactorSystem` class. For example, `system.log` is an alternative way to obtain
  the `Log` service.

## The clock service

Having seen a trivial service example,
let's take a look at a more involved service that connects reactors with
the outside world of events, namely, the `Clock` service.
The `Clock` service is capable of producing time-driven events,
for example, timeouts, countdowns or periodic counting.
