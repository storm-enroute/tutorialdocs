## Services

In the earlier sections,
we learned that reactors delimit concurrent executions,
and that event streams allow routing events within each reactor.
This is already a powerful set of abstractions,
and we can use reactors and event streams to write all kinds of distributed programs.
However, such a model is restricted to reactor computations only --
we cannot, for example, start blocking I/O operations, read from a temperature sensor,
wait until a GPU computation completes, or react to temporal events.
In some cases,
we need to interact with the native capabilities of the OS,
or tap into a rich ecosystem of existing libraries.
For this purpose,
every reactor system has a set of **services** --
protocols that relate event streams to the outside world.

In this section,
we will take a closer look at various services that are available by default,
and also show how to implement custom services and plug them into reactor systems.

### The logging service

We will start with the simplest possible service called `Log`.
This service is used to print logging messages to the standard output.
In the following, we create an anonymous reactor that uses the `Log` service.
We start by importing the `Log` service.

```scala
import io.reactors.services.Log
```

<div class='panel-group' id='acc-1'>
  <div class='panel panel-default'>
    <div class='panel-heading'>
      <h4 class='panel-title'>
        <a data-toggle='collapse' data-parent='#acc-1'
          href='#clps-2'>
          Java
        </a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id='clps-2' class='panel-collapse collapse'>
      <div class='panel-body'>
{% capture s %}
{% include reactors-java-services-log-import.html %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ s | markdownify }}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
Next, we create a reactor system, and start a reactor instance.
The reactor invokes the `service` method on the reactor system,
which returns the service with the specified type.
The reactor then calls the `apply` method on the `log` to print a message,
and seals itself.

```scala
system.spawn(Reactor[String] { self =>
  val log = system.service[Log]
  log("Test reactor started!")
  self.main.seal()
})
```

<div class='panel-group' id='acc-3'>
  <div class='panel panel-default'>
    <div class='panel-heading'>
      <h4 class='panel-title'>
        <a data-toggle='collapse' data-parent='#acc-3'
          href='#clps-4'>
          Java
        </a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id='clps-4' class='panel-collapse collapse'>
      <div class='panel-body'>
{% capture s %}
{% include reactors-java-services-log-example.html %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ s | markdownify }}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
Running the above snippet prints the timestamped message to the standard output.

This example is very simple, but we use it to describe some
important properties of services.

- Reactor system's method `service[S]` returns a service of type `S`.
- The service obtained this way is a lazily initialized singleton instance -- there
  exists at most one instance of the service per reactor system, and it is created
  only after being requested by some reactor.
- Some standard services are eagerly initialized when the reactor system gets
  created. Such services are usually available as a standalone method on the
  `ReactorSystem` class. For example, `system.log` is an alternative way to obtain
  the `Log` service.

### The clock service

Having seen a trivial service example,
let's take a look at a more involved service that connects reactors with
the outside world of events, namely, the `Clock` service.
The `Clock` service is capable of producing time-driven events,
for example, timeouts, countdowns or periodic counting.
This service is standard, so it is available by calling either `system.clock`
or `system.service[Clock]` - both return the same instance.

In the following, we create an anonymous reactor that uses the `Clock` service
to create a timeout event after 1 second. The `timeout` method of the clock service
returns an event stream of the `Unit` type
(more specifically, it returns an `IVar` event stream, i.e. a single-assignment
variable, which always produces at most one event).
We install a callback to the `timeout` event stream, which seals the main channel
of this reactor.

```scala
import scala.concurrent.duration._

val done = Promise[Boolean]()
system.spawn(Reactor[String] { self =>
  system.clock.timeout(1.second) on {
    done.success(true)
    self.main.seal()
  }
})
```

<div class='panel-group' id='acc-5'>
  <div class='panel panel-default'>
    <div class='panel-heading'>
      <h4 class='panel-title'>
        <a data-toggle='collapse' data-parent='#acc-5'
          href='#clps-6'>
          Java
        </a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id='clps-6' class='panel-collapse collapse'>
      <div class='panel-body'>
{% capture s %}
{% include reactors-java-services-timeout.html %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ s | markdownify }}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
The `Clock` service uses a separate timer thread under-the-hood, which sends events
to the reactor when the timer thread decides it is time to do so. The events are
sent on a special channel created by the `timeout` method, so they are seen only
on the corresponding event stream combinator.
Graphically, this looks as follows:

```
                   #---------------------------#
                   |                           |
                   |                           |
   main.channel ---o--> main.events            |
                   |                           |
                   o--> sysEvents              |
                   |                           |
  Channel[Unit] ---o--> system.clock.timeout   |
        ^          |                           |
        |          |                           |
 <Timer thread>    |                           |
                   |                           |
                   #---------------------------#
```
When the main channel gets sealed, the reactor terminates - the `timeout` event
stream creates a daemon channel under-the-hood, which does not prevent our anonymous
reactor from terminating after non-daemon channels are gone.

The `Clock` service depicts a general pattern - when a native entity or an external
event needs to communicate with a reactor, it creates a new channel, and then
asynchronously sends events to it.

### The channels service

Some services provide event streams that work with reactor system internals.
The `Channels` service is one such example - it provides an event-driven view over all
channels that exist in the current reactor system. This allows polling the channels
that are currently available, or waiting until a channel with a specific name becomes
available. Awaiting a channel is particularly useful, as it allows easier handling of
asynchrony between reactors, which is inherent to distributed systems.

As a side-note, we actually saw the `Channels` service earlier, when we used it to
open a second channel in a reactor. The expression `system.channels.open` actually
calls the `open` method on the standard channel service.

In the following, we will construct two reactors. The first reactor will create
a specially named channel after some delay, and the second reactor will await that
channel. When the channel appears, the second reactor will send an event to that
channel.

```scala
val done = Promise[Boolean]()
val first = Reactor[String] { self =>
  system.clock.timeout(1.second) on {
    val c = system.channels.daemon.named("lucky").open[Int]
    c.events on {
      done.success(true)
      self.main.seal()
    }
  }
}
system.spawn(first.withName("first"))

system.spawn(Reactor[String] { self =>
  system.channels.await[Int]("first", "lucky") onEvent { ch =>
    ch ! 7
    self.main.seal()
  }
})
```

<div class='panel-group' id='acc-7'>
  <div class='panel panel-default'>
    <div class='panel-heading'>
      <h4 class='panel-title'>
        <a data-toggle='collapse' data-parent='#acc-7'
          href='#clps-8'>
          Java
        </a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id='clps-8' class='panel-collapse collapse'>
      <div class='panel-body'>
{% capture s %}
{% include reactors-java-services-channels.html %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ s | markdownify }}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
Above, we use the `Clock` service seen earlier to introduce a delay in the
`first` reactor. In the second reactor, we use the `Channels` service to wait
for the channel named `"lucky"` of the reactor named `"first"`.
Both reactors start approximately at the same time.

After one second, the `first` reactor uses the `Channels` service to open a new
daemon channel named `"lucky"`. The first reactor then installs a callback:
when the first event arrives on the lucky channel,
a promise object (used for our testing purposes) must be completed,
and the main channel must be sealed, so that the reactor terminates.

The second reactor gets an event from the `Channels` service - a
channel with the requested name exists, and the second reactor can use it
to communicate. The second reactor sends `7` to the lucky channel, and terminates.

To reiterate, awaiting channels is crucial when establishing temporal order in
an asynchronous system, and the `Channels` service is a useful tool for
this purpose.

### Custom services

Having seen a few existing services, we now show how to create a custom service.
To do this, we must implement the `Protocol.Service` trait,
which has the following members:

```scala
class CustomService(val system: ReactorSystem) extends Protocol.Service {
  def shutdown(): Unit = ???
}
```

Note that every service needs to have a constructor with a single `ReactorSystem`
parameter. The `shutdown` method is called when the corresponding reactor system
gets shut down, and is used to free any resources that the service potentially has.

As noted before, a service is a mechanism that gives access to events that a reactor
normally cannot obtain from other reactors. Let's implement a service that notifies
a reactor when the enclosing reactor system gets shutdown. For this, we will need to
keep a map of the channels that subscribed to the shutdown event.

```scala
class Shutdown(val system: ReactorSystem) extends Protocol.Service {
  private val subscribers = mutable.Set[Channel[Boolean]]()
  private val lock = new AnyRef

  def state: Signal[Boolean] = {
    val shut = system.channels.daemon.open[Boolean]
    lock.synchronized {
      subscribers += shut.channel
    }
    shut.events.toSignal(false).withSubscription(new Subscription {
      def unsubscribe(): Unit = {
        shut.seal()
        lock.synchronized {
          subscribers -= shut.channel
        }
      }
    })
  }

  def shutdown() {
    lock.synchronized {
      for (ch <- subscribers) ch ! true
    }
  }
}
```

The `Shutdown` service keeps the active shutdown notification channels in the
`subscribers` map. When a reactor requests its `state` signal, the service
creates a new connector `shut` for that reactor. The corresponding channel
`shut.channel` into the `subscribers` map. The correspnding `shut.events` event
stream is converted to a signal that is initially `false`, and will remove its
subscription if the reactor later decides to call `unsubscribe`.
Finally, when the system gets shut down, all the existing subscribers receive
a shutdown notification event.

We can now use the `Shutdown` service, for example, as follows:

```scala
val done = Promise[Boolean]()
val system = ReactorSystem.default("test-shutdown-system")
system.spawn(Reactor[Unit] { self =>
  system.service[Shutdown].state on {
    self.main.seal()
    done.success(true)
  }
})
```

Later, when we shut down the system, we expect that the code in the callback runs
and completes the promise:

```scala
system.shutdown()
```

Note that, when implementing a custom service, we are no longer in the same ballpark
as when writing normal reactor code. A service may be invoked by multiple reactors
concurrently, and this is why we had to synchronize access to the `subscribers` map
in the `Shutdown` implementation. In general, when implementing a custom service,
we have to take care to:

- Never block or acquire a lock in the service constructor.
- Ensure that access to shared state of the service is properly synchronized.

In conclusion, you should use custom services whenever you have a native
event-driven API that must deliver events to reactors in your program.
